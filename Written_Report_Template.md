# Kickstarting with Excel
An Analysis of Kickstarter Project Outcomes for Plays
## Overview of Project
The scope of the project is to give the client a snapshot of the results of Kickstarter campaigns similar to the one she wants to launch.
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to show the client the outcomes for kickstarter projects similar to her own looking at the goals, outcomes, and project dates in order for her to be able to better create goals for future kickstarter campaigns.
## Analysis and Challenges
The biggest challenge tends to be making sure your formulas are correct so that you don't end up using incorrect data in your analysis. The other challenge is making sure to use a chart that will give the clearest and most concise picture of the story you're trying to tell.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

By looking at the graph we can see that few Theater campaigns are canceled, regardless of launch date. Success and Failure follow very similar trends, with May having the greatest number of both overall.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

This graph narrows our view to just Kickstarter campaigns in the Play subcategory. We can see at a glance what the goal amounts were, broken into specific dollar amount ranges. From there we can see the percentage of campaigns that succeeded, failed, or were cancelled and the goal range they fall into.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
As stated previously, the challenges and difficulties in this project revolve around making sure that the data being used in chart creation is accurate, and that the graphs are clearly telling the story in a way the client will understand.
## Results
Based off the charts, starting a campaign in May and keeping the goal amount in either the $5,000 or less, or $35,000 to $44,999 would give her the best chance for success.
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
It appears that campaigns launched in May have the greatest chance of success. Overall, I can also conclude that in general, more campaigns for Theater Kickstarters succeed than fail, and very few are cancelled regardless of start date.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Kickstarters for Plays tend to have the highest success rate when their goals are below $5,000 or in the range of $35,000 to $44,999. The failure and success rates based on goal categories appear to be mirror images of each other.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The data is stale, so more recent data would be helpful to see if trends have changed. We also don't have the data on how long of a campaign she wants to run. The data also doesn't show what social media advertising campaigns, if any were used.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A graph comparing the length of a campaign to the outcome and amount raised could be helpful.
